# Predicting Forest Cover Type: Multi-class classification 

This project is a Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/

**Description:** A dataset of forest cover type for a given 30 x 30-meter cell determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data with independent variables were then derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey, and USFS is provided. The objective is to use the above dataset to train a machine-learning model to predict the forest cover type from unknown cartographic variables using machine learning.
